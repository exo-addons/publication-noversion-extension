publication-noversion-extension
==================

This is an eXo Platform extension to disable versioning using Authoring Publication Workflows.
It's useful especially in case you don't wonder about Version History of your nodes and if you don't want to get Giga bytes stored in your JCR.
This extension allows you to keep only one LIVE version and one DRAFT version
